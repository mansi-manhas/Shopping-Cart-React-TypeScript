### Tech Stack

- [React.js](https://reactjs.org/) for creating interactive and component based UIs.
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for type checking and creating custom types.
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) for setting up the application environment.
- [FakeStore](https://fakestoreapi.com/) for using their API and populating the application with sample data.
- [Material UI](https://mui.com/) for creating simple and customizable UI.
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) for creating custom components using CSS.

### Application Flow

- Application would show a loading screen while the data is being fetched.
- User can add any item in the cart. 
- Cart will be dynamically populated with the times user want to add.
- Dynamic counter for showing the cart value, and increasing item count as per user's interaction.
- User can increase the amount of items, and total prices would be calculated as per the cart items.
- Using `QueryClientProvider` from `react-query` to add context for the React.js application.
